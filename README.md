# Hi, I'm Karanveer Sharma 👋

### 🚀 Software Engineer 

I am a **performance-driven Software Engineer** with a passion for designing and optimizing complex, distributed architectures, particularly within a **Microservices** environment. I specialize in the architecture and optimization of **high-throughput backend services**. My objective is to immediately integrate into a team and contribute to building systems that are engineered for peak **efficiency and low latency**.

### 🛠️ Core Engineering Stack

I believe in using the right tool for the job. While my core focus is on Golang, my experience spans across performance and system-level tools:

| Category | Skills & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Backend** | **Go (Golang)** (Core for high-concurrency systems) |
| **Distributed Systems** | **Microservices**, **Apache Kafka** (Messaging), **Redis** (Caching) |
| **Data & Structure** | **MySQL**, **C++**, **DSA** (Algorithms, Graphs, DP) |
| **Full Stack** | **Next.js**, **JavaScript** |


### 🌐 Featured Project Spotlight
